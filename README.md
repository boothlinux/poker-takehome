A game / 5 card poker hand comparison tool, written for Swept by Colton Booth on October 19th 2021

## Overview
This tool can compare poker hands that are entered in the CLI, or it can shuffle a deck of cards and draw two hands and compare those. 

## Usage
This tool is very easy to use. To enter your own hands enter 'E' (without the quotes) at the prompt. It will then prompt you to enter your first hand. Go ahead and enter 5 cards seperated by a space for the first hand e.g: Q Q 4 7 9

It will then prompt you for the second hand, enter your second hand in the same mannaer as described for the first hand above

The tool will then compare the two hands and will tell you who won ( or if it was a tie)

If you do not want to enter yor own hands, and instead get two random hands from a shuffled deck of cards you can enter any character other than 'E' at the first prompt.

## Code
The code should be pretty self explanatory, but please feel free to reach out to me if you need some further guidance.
